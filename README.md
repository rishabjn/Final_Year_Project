# Final year Project : Profile Verification using blockchain
>The resumes submitted to the universities and recruiters contain many counterfeit projects and certiﬁcates. 
>In the current scenario, third party organizations are used to verify these resumes. In our project, recruiters can directly authenticate the certiﬁcates using our application ”proﬁle veriﬁcation system”. This eliminates the counterfeit certiﬁcates and provides easy authentication.

>Employers face a major hiring hurdle, verifying information on a candidate’s resume.A survey by one of the largest online job ﬁnder sites, CareerBuilder, shows that a staggering 58 percent of employers have caught a lie on a resume. 

>The site has more than 23 million unique visitors and over 1.6 million jobs. Imagine a world where certiﬁcations were written securely, where they could not be deleted or changed. 

>Now, sharing them with employers for recruitment becomes transparent and easy. Smart chain oﬀers this solution for digital educational certiﬁcates.


# Working

>A student has multiple achivements or certiﬁcates which consists of the courses and projects which he/she has completed. 

>He/she uploads these documents highlighting his achievements/certiﬁcations on the platform where these remain persistent. 

>The veriﬁers (which can be professors or mentors/teachers) can inspect these documents for genuineness. If the documents are found to be genuine, they are added to the blockchain. 

>A set of three teachers are required to validate a certiﬁcate. If anyone veriﬁer or miner marks it as false certiﬁcate then it is not validated further and the certiﬁcate is dropped. 

>Once a set of three teachers have veriﬁed the certiﬁcate then there is permanently added to the network.
